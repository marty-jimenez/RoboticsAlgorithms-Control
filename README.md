**Project 3:** Tasked with creating two navigation algorithms. The first being Bug 1; an extensive search algorithm for the goal point where the robot circumnavigates an object searching for the closest point to a certain goal. The second being Bug 2; a greedy search algorithm that goes to the first best option towards the goal point. More details on the assignment can be found in the pdf file inside the Project 3 folder.
